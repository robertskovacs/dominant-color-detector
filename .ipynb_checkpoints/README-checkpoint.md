# color-extractor

This project aims to create a tool which can map the dominant colours of an image using k-means clustering algorithm.

## Theory

First of all let's say that that we can slice the images pixel to pixel and create a vector space (RGB color space). In order to cluster the colors in the color space we can apply the K-means clustering algorithm.
